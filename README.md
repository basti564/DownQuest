### Downgrade and download Oculus Quest, Rift, Go and Gear VR apps right from your Browser.

#### Features

#### Tutorial
1. Install this Extension
2. Navigate to https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/
3. Login with your Facebook/Oculus account
4. Choose the store you want to visit (Quest, Rift, Go, GearVR)
5. Go to the app you want to downgrade/download
6. Click the green "Downgrade" button below the "Purchase" button
7. Select your release channel and then the version you want to download
8. Wait for the download to finish and use ADB to sideload the APK (and OBB) or launch the exe incase it's a rift game

TIP: When downloading RIFT apps make a special folder just for downloading, because this extension can't download files to the common directories like "Downloads" or "Desktop" for security reasons.
