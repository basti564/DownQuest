### Downgrade and download Oculus Quest, Rift, Go and Gear VR apps right from your Browser.

#### Features
- Downgrade Mobile Binaries and Assets
- Downgrade PC Binaries and Assets
- Download DLCs
- Download DLC bundles

#### Tutorial
1. Navigate to https://www.meta.com/experiences/
2. Choose the store you want to visit from the dropdown in the top left
3. Go to the app you want to downgrade/download
4. Click the green "Downgrade" button below the "Purchase" button
5. Select your release channel and then the version you want to download
6. Log into secure.oculus.com
7. Wait for the download to finish and use ADB to sideload the APK (and OBB) or launch the exe incase it's a rift game

TIP: When downloading RIFT apps make a special folder just for downloading, because this extension can't download files to the common directories like "Downloads" or "Desktop" for security reasons.
